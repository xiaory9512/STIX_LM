This investigation report outlines the activities of “Adversary Bravo,” a threat actor identified in May 2015, known for using phishing attacks to deliver remote access malware, specifically a variant of Poison Ivy. Adversary Bravo conducts spear phishing campaigns to trick targets into executing malicious payloads, which is a key part of their initial compromise strategy. The Poison Ivy variant they use, named "Poison Ivy Variant d1c6," disguises itself as an executable file such as "resume.pdf" and creates a specific registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WSALG2). Indicators of this malware include specific file hashes (MD5 and SHA-1). This documentation highlights Adversary Bravo's methodical approach to deploying this trojan, underscoring the importance of vigilance against such sophisticated cyber threats.
