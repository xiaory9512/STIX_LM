This scenario describes a sophisticated cyber operation targeting the Branistan People’s Party (BPP). This operation, suspected to be backed by the Franistan government, aims to disrupt the BPP through multiple attack vectors. The operation includes two main campaigns: "Operation Bran Flakes" and "Operation Raisin Bran."

"Operation Bran Flakes" focuses on inserting false information into the BPP's web pages to influence Branistan's election. This campaign, which began in January 2016, systematically infiltrated the BPP's website. The other campaign, "Operation Raisin Bran," initiated in February 2016, is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack aimed at overwhelming the BPP’s web servers, thereby disrupting their online operations.

These attacks are believed to be carried out by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as "APT BPP," characterized by its strategic approach and government-level resources. The primary motivation is ideological dominance, with a clear objective to target the BPP and undermine Branistan's electoral process.

Key figures in this threat operation include leaders supported by Franistan Intelligence, employing techniques such as content spoofing and HTTP flood attacks against the BPP website. The overall goal of this operation is to weaken the BPP's influence and dominate the political landscape of Branistan.
