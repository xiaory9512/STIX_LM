This scenario consists of two cyber threat companies, Alpha and Beta, who share threat intelligence. A malicious URL was seen on Alphaâ€™s network and an indicator was generated to capture this information. Alpha then shares this information with company Beta who later sees this indicator on their systems. Beta then creates a sighting of this indicator to share that this indicator has been spotted.
