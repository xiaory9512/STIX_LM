This scenario describes on Stark Industries, a STIX producer, and their method of applying object markings to an indicator. On April 14, 2017, Stark Industries created a "Statement" marking definition with copyright information and a "Traffic Light Protocol" (TLP: AMBER) marking definition for an indicator describing a known malicious IP address (`10.0.0.0`) involved in malicious activity. The TLP: AMBER marking restricts the usage and sharing of this indicator, ensuring it is handled with appropriate sensitivity. The indicator, valid from April 14, 2017, helps maintain controlled distribution and compliance with Stark Industries' copyright policies.
