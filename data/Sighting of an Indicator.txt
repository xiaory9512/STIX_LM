Alpha, based at info@alpha.org, discovered a malicious URL (http://paypa1.banking.com) on their network. This URL was flagged as potentially associated with malicious activities and was noted in their system on February 27, 2017, at 13:57 UTC. Recognized under the indicator ID "indicator--9299f726-ce06-492e-8472-2b52ccb53191", this URL has been listed on several blacklist sites and is categorized under 'malicious-activity'.

Once Alpha identified and documented this threat, they shared the details with Beta Cyber Intelligence Company. Beta, reachable at info@beta.com, later detected this indicator on their systems. On February 28, 2017, Beta documented a sighting of this indicator, confirming its presence within their network between 21:37:11 and 21:37:11 UTC the previous day. This sighting was cataloged under the sighting ID "sighting--8356e820-8080-4692-aa91-ecbe94006833".

This collaborative effort between Alpha and Beta underlines the critical role of shared intelligence in cyber security, enabling both organizations to more effectively track and respond to cyber threats.
