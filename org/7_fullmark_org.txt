In this case, we are dealing with a sophisticated threat actor known as "Adversary Bravo," who operates as both a spy and a criminal. Their primary method of attack involves spear phishing campaigns aimed at delivering malware to targeted victims. The malware they deploy is identified as "Poison Ivy Variant d1c6," which is a remote access trojan (RAT). This malware is typically used during the initial compromise phase of an attack, following the Mandiant attack lifecycle model.

Adversary Bravo has been linked to several phishing attacks that leverage this remote access trojan to gain unauthorized access to targeted systems. These phishing attempts are strategically crafted to trick users into clicking malicious links or opening compromised attachments, enabling the deployment of the Poison Ivy malware variant. The attack pattern, classified under CAPEC-98, confirms that phishing is the core technique used by Adversary Bravo to infiltrate networks.

Moreover, the identity behind Adversary Bravo remains largely anonymous, with limited public details beyond their involvement in these phishing campaigns. However, it is confirmed that their activities have been ongoing since at least 2015.
