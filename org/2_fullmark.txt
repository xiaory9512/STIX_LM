The <threat-actor><name>Fake BPP (Branistan Peoples Party)</name></threat-actor>, identified as a <threat-actor><threat_actor_types>nation-state</threat_actor_types></threat-actor> threat actor, is suspected of influencing the election in <identity><name>Branistan</name></identity>. This group, acting under <threat-actor><primary_motivation>ideology</primary_motivation></threat-actor> and seeking <threat-actor><secondary_motivations>dominance</secondary_motivations></threat-actor>, has engaged in sophisticated attacks aimed at disrupting the <identity><name>Branistan Peoples Party</name></identity> (<identity><name>BPP</name></identity>).

Notably, the <identity><name>Franistan Intelligence</name></identity>, an <identity><identity_class>organization</identity_class></identity>, has been linked to the threat actor through multiple cyber operations. Two prominent campaigns were identified: <campaign><name>Operation Bran Flakes</name></campaign>, initiated on <campaign><first_seen>2016-01-08</first_seen></campaign>, which aimed to hack and insert false information on the <identity><external_references><source_name>website</source_name></external_references></identity>, and <campaign><name>Operation Raisin Bran</name></campaign>, launched on <campaign><first_seen>2016-02-07</first_seen></campaign>, designed to conduct a <attack-pattern><name>DDOS</name></attack-pattern> attack to flood <campaign><objective>www.bpp.bn</objective></campaign>.

The <intrusion-set><name>APT BPP</name></intrusion-set>, also known as <intrusion-set><aliases>Bran-teaser</aliases></intrusion-set>, is a <intrusion-set><resource_level>government</resource_level></intrusion-set>-backed intrusion set targeting <intrusion-set><goals>the Branistan election</goals></intrusion-set> and attempting to disrupt the <identity><name>BPP</name></identity> through <intrusion-set><sophistication>strategic</sophistication></intrusion-set> use of <attack-pattern><name>Content Spoofing</name></attack-pattern> and <attack-pattern><name>HTTP Flood</name></attack-pattern> attacks.

These campaigns used advanced attack methods such as <attack-pattern><name>Content Spoofing</name></attack-pattern> (<attack-pattern><external_references><external_id>CAPEC-148</external_id></external_references></attack-pattern>) and <attack-pattern><name>HTTP Flood</name></attack-pattern> (<attack-pattern><external_references><external_id>CAPEC-488</external_id></external_references></attack-pattern>). All operations appear to be primarily motivated by the <threat-actor><name>Fake BPP</name></threat-actor>'s desire for <threat-actor><secondary_motivations>dominance</secondary_motivations></threat-actor> in Branistan's political landscape.

The <identity><name>Branistan Peoples Party</name></identity> continues to be the primary target of these attacks, with persistent efforts from the <threat-actor><name>Fake BPP</name></threat-actor> to <campaign><objective>impersonate</objective></campaign> their identity and manipulate the public's perception of their policies.
